fill all masks possible (Solved not optimized) <br>
    [*] fill first range <br>
    [-] duplicated mask (Solved) <br>

generate a random mask which will generate the problem of a form ip address <br>
    - find : <br>
        the range of subnet <br>
        ip network <br>
        broadcast <br>
        first ip <br>
        last ip <br>

first step (generate mask) (done) <br>

next step based on the mask lets generate a random ip <br>
    in network portion things seems easy <br>
    but in host portion we need to define a range and reserve the network ip and broadcast ip <br>

    lets generate the partitions of the subnet mask that we could work in them <br>
